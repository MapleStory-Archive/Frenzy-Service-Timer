Todo:

-   [ ] Copy name on click
-   [ ] Use localStorage to save Client objects and preserve list in case of refreshes
-   [ ] Map field toggle (for the ones who go by channel and in game names only)
-   [ ] Global timer to keep track of casting every 9:30 minutes (variable)
-   [ ] Clean up CSS

... and a lot more.
